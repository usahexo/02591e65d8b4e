The Wizards are owned by Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which also owns the NHL's Washington Capitals and WNBA's Washington Mystics.

The franchise was established in 1961 as the Chicago Packers, an expansion teamudiately after the NBA awarded a second franchise to Chicago. The team was renamed to Zephyrs in 1962, then to Bullets in 1973, and finally to Wizards in 1997.

The Wizards have appeared in four NBA Finals, winning one championship in 1978. They most recently made the playoffs in 2018, where they were swept by the Toronto Raptors 4-0 in the first round.

# How did the Wizards get their name?

In 1961, when Chicago was awarded an NBA expansion franchise, the founders held a "name-the-team" contest. Over 10,000 entries were submitted with "Wizards" being one of the top choices. The name was selected due to its magical connotations and because it fit well with Washington's local sports teams: The Redskins (NFL), Capitals (NHL), and Nationals (MLB).

#  What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It takes a set of source files and generates a complete, static website. Hugo is designed to be fast, easy to use, and easy to extend.

# Why Use Hugo?

There are many reasons to use Hugo:

Hugo is fast. It can generate websites quickly, even on slow machines.

Hugo is easy to use. You don't need to learn a new language or framework to use Hugo. Just write your content in Markdown and let Hugo do the rest.

Hugo is easy to extend. You can add new content types, templates, and themes without modifying the core code.

# Getting Started with Hugo

To get started with Hugo, you'll need the following:

A computer running Go 1.11 or higher. You can find installation instructions for many platforms on the Hugo website.
Git installed and configured properly (see the Git documentation for instructions). A copy of the Hugo source code (see the next section for instructions).
The hugo executable (you can install this with go get github.com/gohugoio/hugo ). 
An editor or IDE of your choice (see the list of recommended editors). 

Once you have all of these installed, you're ready to start using Hugo! The easiest way to do that is by creating a new project: 

mkdir my-new-project cd my-new-project git init hugo new site . 

This will create a new project directory called "my-new-project" and initialize a Git repository in it. Then it will create a basic website using the default theme and content type. To start writing content, open the "content/" directory in your project and add some files there. The content in these files will be displayed on your website's pages. You can see an example of this on the Hugo website's home page: https://gohugoio.github.io/.
