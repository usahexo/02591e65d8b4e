Rivers Casino will be adding table games this week, according to a spokesperson from the casino. This move comes after Illinois legalized table games in early June.

The new table games will include blackjack, craps, and roulette. In order to prepare for the addition of these games, Rivers Casino has been investing in new gaming equipment and staff training.

“We are excited to offer our guests table games at Rivers Casino,” said the spokesperson. “We have put in a lot of hard work to get ready for this and we believe that our guests will enjoy the experience.”

In addition to the standard table games, Rivers Casino will also be offering a number of specialty tables. These include Ultimate Texas Hold’em, Three Card Poker, and Four Card Poker.

Rivers Casino is one of six casinos in Illinois that will be offering table games. The other casinos are Harrah’s Joliet, Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino Joliet, Majestic Star Casino Hammond, and Par-A-Dice Hotel East Peoria.

#  Rivers Casino Sees Increase In Gambling Revenue

 ## Allegheny County

The Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania has seen an increase in gambling revenue this past year. The casino was able to bring in $250 million from slot machines and table games, up from the $233 million it made in 2017.

Rivers Casino is owned and operated by Rush Street Gaming, a company that owns and operates several casinos across the country. Gambling revenue is an important part of their business, and the increase at Rivers Casino helped offset a decline at another property of theirs, SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia.

The increase in gambling revenue at Rivers Casino is largely attributed to a new smoking policy enacted last year. The casino banned smoking inside, which pushed more people outside to gamble. This also led to an increase in food and beverage spending, as people took advantage of the new restaurants and bars at the casino.

While the rivers casino sees increase in gambling revenue, it’s not all good news. The number of people who visit the casino has declined slightly. In 2018, there were around 9.7 million visitors, compared to 10 million visitors in 2017.
