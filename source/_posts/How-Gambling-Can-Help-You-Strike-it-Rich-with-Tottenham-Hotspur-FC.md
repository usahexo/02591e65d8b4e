Gambling on Tottenham Hotspur FC can be a lucrative venture, as the Premier League side has a history of success. With Mauricio Pochettino in charge and a number of young stars in the squad, Tottenham Hotspur are primed to make a run at the title this season.

If you’re looking to make some money gambling on Tottenham Hotspur FC, there are a few things you need to know. First, it’s important to understand the odds for each match. You can find these odds at various online sportsbooks, such as [Bovada](https://www.bovada.lv/spSports/soccer).

Bets that offer the best return on investment (ROI) typically include wagering on both teams to score and Correct Score betting. Let’s take a look at an example:

**Tottenham Hotspur vs Liverpool**

If you think that Tottenham Hotspur will win this match, you can bet on them at odds of 2.50 at Bovada. If they happen to lose, your bet will still be paid out - but at a lower rate of 1.50. This is known as the **-1 handicap** . In order for you to win your bet, Tottenham Hotspur must win by two goals or more. A draw or Liverpool victory would mean that you would lose your bet.

You could also choose to bet on Liverpool instead at odds of 3.00 . If they manage to win, you would receive your original stake back plus an additional profit based on the final result (e.g., 3.00 x your original stake). However, if Liverpool loses then you would lose your entire stake . 
Returning to our previous example, let’s say that you think that Tottenham Hotspur will beat Liverpool by two goals or more . You could bet £10 on Spurs with Bovada and receive £25 back if they win (2.50 x 10 = 25). Alternatively, you could place the same £10 bet on Liverpool and receive £30 back if they win (3.00 x 10 = 30). In either case, you stand to make a profit if your chosen team wins . 
However, it's important to remember that betting involves risk and you could lose money as well as make it .  So always gamble responsibly!
