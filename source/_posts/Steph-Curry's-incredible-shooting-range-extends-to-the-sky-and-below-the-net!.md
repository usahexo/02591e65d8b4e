#  Steph Curry's incredible shooting range extends to the sky and below the net!

Golden State Warriors’ Steph Curry is widely-known for his incredible shooting range. This was evident in the team’s most recent game against the Utah Jazz, where Curry made a shot from just inside the half-court line.

However, what is not as widely known is that Curry’s shooting range extends all the way to the sky and below the net. In a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in February 2016, Curry made a shot from just inside the three-point line that went in off the underside of the net!

This jaw-dropping feat was just one example of Curry’s amazing range. His shots regularly defy conventional wisdom and challenge defenders to cover as much space as possible.

It is this uncanny ability to score from anywhere on the court that has made Curry one of the most feared players in the NBA. Defenders simply cannot relax for a second when he has the ball, lest they give him an open look at the basket.

#  Giannis Antetokounmpo is a giant on the court, with skills that reach above and below the rim.3. The Lakers' Lebron James domination of the court extends to all areas - even above and below the hoop.4. Baseball players are skilled at hitting balls both high and low, proving their talent stretches beyond just contact with a bat.5. Soccer players have to be aware of threats from all angles - even those above and below them on the pitch.

When it comes to Antetokounmpo's skillset, there really is no area of the court he isn't deadly in. His height - at 6'11" - gives him a distinct advantage over most players when it comes to grabbing rebounds or blocking shots, but his jumping ability and hand-eye coordination make him just as dangerous on offense. He's able to take advantage of opponents who might underestimate his skills by scoring both high and low, often catching defenders off guard with his agility and leaping ability.

Similarly, James has proven himself to be one of the most versatile players in the NBA. He can score from anywhere on the court, and is also an excellent defender and rebounder. In fact, many people argue that his all-around game rivals that of Michael Jordan himself. In recent years, he has shown an increasing proficiency in scoring from close range as well as from beyond the three-point line - making him a threat to opponents no matter where they stand on the court.

Clearly, both Antetokounmpo and James are skilled athletes whose abilities extend beyond just their particular sport. They are both highly versatile players who can dominate any opponent they face. With Antetokounmpo's height and James' athleticism, there really is no telling how far their talents will take them.
