#  Circus of Horror game opens in King's Mountain!

After a month-long delay, the Circus of Horror game is now open in King's Mountain! The amusement park was scheduled to open at the end of September, but unexpected repairs pushed back the date.

The Circus of Horror is a horror-themed amusement park that has been traveling around the country for the past few years. It features haunted houses, scare zones, and other attractions designed to scare the wits out of visitors.

The park's most popular attraction is the Haunted Hayride. Riders are taken on a tractor-drawn cart through a dark forest filled with spooky creatures. Other popular attractions include The Cage, which features actors dressed as monsters who jump out at visitors, and The Crypt, which is a maze full of zombies and other monsters.

Tickets for the Circus of Horror cost $29.99 per person. However, discounts are available for children, seniors, and military personnel.

#  New casino in King's Mountain is a Circus of Horror!

A new casino has opened in King's Mountain and it is nothing short of a circus of horror! The casino is incredibly loud and employees are rude and unhelpful. Worse yet, the casino is incredibly dirty! The floors are littered with cigarette butts, gum wrappers, and other trash. The bathrooms are disgustingly dirty, with urine on the floors and vomit in the stalls.

The casino also features some very strange games. One game is called "Russian Roulette", which involves spinning a wheel to see if you will win money or lose all your chips. Another game is called "Red Dog", which is just like blackjack, but with worse odds.

Overall, this new casino is a complete disaster. Avoid it at all costs!
