#  Zenit's New Precisely Like Blackjack Greeting Card Game Is A Hit! 

Russian developer Zenit has released a new game called Precisely Like Blackjack and it has been an instant hit! The game is a blend of blackjack and poker and players can enjoy its simple rules and fast-paced gameplay.

Precisely Like Blackjack is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The goal is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer does, or by having a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. As in blackjack, cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while face cards (jacks, queens, kings) are worth 10 points each, and an ace can be worth 1 or 11 points.

The game begins with both the player and dealer receiving two cards. The player's cards are shown to the dealer, but the dealer's cards are not revealed to the player. After viewing their cards, players must decide whether to "hit" (take another card), "stand" (end their turn), "double down" (play two hands at once with doubled stakes), or "split" (split a hand into two separate hands). If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose regardless of what the dealer accomplishes.

If the player stands or doubles down on any hand totaling less than 21 points, then the dealer will automatically draw another card unless that would cause them to bust; if the dealer busts, then all players still in the hand win. If both the player and dealer have 21 points after all additional cards have been drawn, it's a tie or push and no one wins or loses money on that hand.

The game moves quickly and is great for those looking for a more challenging blackjack experience without all of the rules overhead. Give Precisely Like Blackjack a try today!
