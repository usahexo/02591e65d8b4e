# What Happens If Player and House Both Bust in Blackjack?

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games played all over the world. It is a game of both skill and luck and requires players to make strategic decisions to beat the house. One common question that often arises during a game of blackjack is what happens if both the player and house bust? 

In blackjack, the objective is to get a hand with a total value of 21 or as close to it as possible without going over. The dealer deals two cards to the player and two cards to himself, with one card facing up and one facing down. The cards are then evaluated based on their values, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards worth 10, and the Ace worth either 1 or 11, depending on what is more beneficial for the player.

If either the player or the house goes over 21, they bust and lose the game. But what happens if both the player and house bust? 

When both the player and the house bust, the hand with the highest total value wins. In blackjack, the house always plays last, so if the player busts, the house can still win by not busting. However, if both the player and house bust, the one with the highest total value before the bust wins the game. 

For example, let's say the player has a total hand value of 22 and the house has a total hand value of 23. Both the player and house have busted, but the house wins because its hand had a higher total value before the bust. 

It is essential to understand that if both the player and the house have the same total hand value before the bust, the game is a tie, and no one wins or loses. This is known as a push, and the player gets back their original bet. 

In conclusion, when both the player and the house bust in blackjack, the hand with the highest total value before the bust wins the game. If both have the same total hand value before the bust, the game is a tie, and the player gets back their original bet. Knowing this rule is important to understand the game's outcome and to make informed decisions during gameplay.
