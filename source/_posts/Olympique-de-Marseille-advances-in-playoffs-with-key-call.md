#  Olympique de Marseille advances in playoffs with key call

In the soccer world, there are many controversial calls that go unnoticed by fans. However, on Tuesday, April 10th, one such call affected Olympique de Marseille in their matchup against FC Salzburg. In the 59th minute with the game tied at 1-1, Marseille forward Dimitri Payet was taken down in the penalty area by defender Stefan Lainer, resulting in a penalty kick. Payet then converted the penalty to give Marseille a 2-1 lead.

This key call allowed Marseille to advance to the semifinal of the Europa League with a 3-2 aggregate victory over FC Salzburg. In addition, this call is important for two other reasons. First, it allows Marseille to continue their quest for their first European trophy since 1993. Second, it gives Payet a chance to redemption following his poor performance in last year’s World Cup semifinal for France.

While it is clear that this call was decisive in the outcome of the match, it is also important to look at what led up to it. In the first half, both teams had chances to score but neither could find the back of the net. The first goal of the game came in the 59th minute when Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin took a shot that deflected off of FC Salzburg defender Andreas Ulmer and into the goal.

The second goal for Marseille came just three minutes later when Payet was taken down in the penalty area. This gave Marseille a 2-1 lead and they would hold on to win 2-1. With this victory, Marseille advances to the semifinal of the Europa League where they will face Red Bull Leipzig.

While this key call allowed Marseille to advance, it is also important to note that they were able to win despite playing without two of their best players. Forward Valere Germain and midfielder Andre Zambo Anguissa were both unavailable due to injury. This makes Marseille’s victory even more impressive as they were able to overcome these injuries and advance in spite of them.

#  Marseille sunk after costly late-game call

In one of the costliest refereeing decisions in sports history, Olympique de Marseille was relegated from France’s top division soccer league on Sunday following a 3-1 home loss to Caen.

With the game knotted at 1-1 and time running out, Marseille midfielder Dimitri Payet was standing just outside the penalty area when he was called for a hand ball.

The call incensed Marseille players and fans, who felt the ball had struck Payet’s chest.

“It’s a scandal, an absolute disgrace,” Marseille defender Patrice Evra said after the match. “We played well but it’s not fair. We were relegated because of this refereeing mistake.”

The resulting penalty kick was converted by Caen’s Andy Delort to give the visitors the victory.

That goal proved to be decisive as Marseille finished one point shy of safety with two games remaining in the season.

#  Would-be game-winner for Olympique De Marseille called back for offensive foul

In the 95th minute of their match against Dijon FCO, Olympique De Marseille was awarded a penalty that would have given them the win. The penalty was called back, however, after it was determined that the player who took the shot had stepped on the keeper’s foot while taking the kick.

The players and fans of Marseille were understandably outraged by the call. Some people even claimed that it was a deliberate act on the part of the referee in order to prevent Marseille from winning. This, of course, cannot be confirmed.

What is clear is that this call cost Marseille 2 points in what could be a very tight race for a spot in Europe next season.

#  Late call dooms Olympique De Marseille against rivals

Olympique De Marseille were looking to extend their unbeaten streak in all competitions this season, with a win over rivals Paris Saint Germain. However, they only had 10 minutes left to overturn a two-goal deficit when defender Hiroki Sakai was sent off for a late challenge.

Without their Japanese full-back, they were unable to mount a comeback and lost 3-0. PSG’s Marco Verratti said after the match: “It’s never easy against 10 men, but we played well and took our chances. We are very happy with the result.”

Marseille coach Rudi Garcia said of the sending off: “It’s incredible that he has been sent off for that. It was not even a foul. He barely touched him (Edinson Cavani). I think it changed the game because we had to change our system and it became much harder for us.”

The defeat leaves Marseille third in Ligue 1, eight points behind leaders PSG.

#  Controversial call helps Marseille edge out Lyon

In a tightly contested match between Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique de Marseille, it was the away side who managed to snatch all three points with a 1-0 victory. However, the winning goal was met with much controversy as it appeared that Dimitri Payet’s strike shouldn’t have stood as he was in an offside position when the ball was played to him.

The win takes Marseille up to second place in the table, just two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, while Lyon remain in fifth position.

Despite the controversial nature of the goal, Marseille manager Rudi Garcia refused to be drawn on the decision after the game. “I didn’t see it again, but I think it was offside. It doesn’t matter; what counts is we got the three points. We should have killed the game off but we allowed Lyon back into it and made life difficult for ourselves.”

Lyon boss Bruno Genesio was equally tight-lipped on the goal, simply saying: “I didn’t see it again so I can’t comment on it. But even if it had been offside, we still should have scored – or at least created more chances. We were too passive in the first half and paid for it.”

The only goal of the game arrived in the 38th minute as Payet collected a ball from Florian Thauvin before rounding Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and slotting home. The assistant referee raised his flag immediately, but after a consultation with his superior he allowed the goal to stand much to the anger of the Lyon players and fans.
