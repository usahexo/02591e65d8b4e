#  There's Only a 1 in 36 Chance of Getting 3 of a Kind with K8

The game of K8 is one that is popular amongst casino enthusiasts and players around the world. It is a simple game that can be learned quickly, but also provides a level of excitement and anticipation for those who are looking to win big. In order to play the game, you need at least two people, with each player being dealt six cards face down. After the cards have been dealt, the player to the left of the dealer begins the game by flipping over the top card of their deck-this is known as the "starter." The next player then flips over the next card in their deck, and if this card matches the starter, they then put one finger up. If it doesn't match, they put two fingers up. If it's a 3 of a kind, they put three fingers up. If it's something else, they just put one finger up. Play then goes to the next player on the left who flips over their card and so forth. The goal of the game is to go out first, and the first player to do so wins all of the cards that have been played thus far.

Now that you know how to play K8, let's take a look at some possible odds and strategies involved in this exciting game. Whenever you're playing any casino game, it's important to understand some basic odds in order to give yourself the best chance at winning. With K8 specifically, there is only a 1 in 36 chance of getting three of a kind with a king (K8). This means that if you're playing against someone else and they have k 8 as their hand, your chances of winning are significantly lower than if you had something like a 2 or 3 as your starter card. As such, it's important to be aware of what other players are holding and make smart decisions based on those cards.

Another thing to keep in mind when playing K8 is that it's always better to go out first rather than last. This is because the first player has already seen all of the cards that have been played-including those held by their opponents-while the last player only knows about the cards that were played after them. This puts them at a disadvantage since they don't know what kinds of hands their opponents could potentially be holding. For this reason, it's always important to be aware of your position in relation to other players and make informed decisions accordingly.

K8 is an easy game to learn but provides plenty of excitement for those looking for an edge against their opponents. With only a 1 in 36 chance of getting three of a kind with a king (K8), it's important to be aware of basic odds and strategies if you want to come out ahead in this fun casino game!

#  Pair of Kings and a Pair of Eights is the Worst Hand You Can Get in Poker

Texas Hold'em Poker is a game that is all about making the best hand possible using the two cards dealt to each player and the five community cards that are placed on the table. While there are many different hands that can be made, some are obviously better than others.

The best possible hand in poker is a royal flush, which is made up of the ace, king, queen, jack, and ten of the same suit. A royal flush is followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair. The worst possible hand in poker is two kings and two eights - also known as "a pair of kings and a pair of eights."

When you are dealt a pair of kings and a pair of eights, you have four different ways to make two pairs. However, only one of those hands will be any good - and even then it will only be a two-pair hand. The other three hands will all be losers.

The reason why this hand is so bad is because you have no chance of making a good poker hand. There are no straights or flushes to be made, and there are only four different ways to make two pairs. This means that your chances of winning with this hand are very slim - especially against multiple opponents.

If you are ever dealt this hand in poker, you should fold immediately and look for another opportunity to make a better hand. There is simply no way to win with this combination of cards - so don't even waste your time trying!

#  You're More Likely to Roll Double Sixes than to Get 3 of a Kind with K8 in Poker
