<p>Hugo is fast. It can generate websites quickly, even on slow machines.</p>
<p>Hugo is easy to use. You don’t need to learn a new language or framework to use Hugo. Just write your content in Markdown and let Hugo do the rest.</p>
<p>Hugo is easy to extend. You can add new content types, templates, and themes without modifying the core code.</p>
<h1 id="Getting-Started-with-Hugo"><a href="#Getting-Started-with-Hugo" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started with Hugo"></a>Getting Started with Hugo</h1><p>To get started with Hugo, you’ll need the following:</p>
<p>A computer running Go 1.11 or higher. You can find installation instructions for many platforms on the Hugo website.<br>Git installed and configured properly (see the Git documentation for instructions). A copy of the Hugo source code (see the next section for instructions).<br>The hugo executable (you can install this with go get github.com&#x2F;gohugoio&#x2F;hugo ).<br>An editor or IDE of your choice (see the list of recommended editors). </p>
<p>Once you have all of these installed, you’re ready to start using Hugo! The easiest way to do that is by creating a new project: </p>
<p>mkdir my-new-project cd my-new-project git init hugo new site . </p>

To start writing content, open the “content&#x2F;“ directory in your project and add some files there. The content in these files will be displayed on your website’s pages. You can see an example of this on the Hugo website’s home page: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gohugoio.github.io/">https://gohugoio.github.io/</a>. </p>
